This repository means to collect my personal notes and necessary materials throughout my undergraduate study in ___Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University (XJTLU) & University of Liverpool (UoL)___, majoring ___Information and Computing Science (ICS) & Computer Science___.

It is predicted to include 3 main parts: Sophomore & Junior & Senior, focusing on major courses excluding Freshman year and Language courses. Each course will collect several materials including class notes (by __Notion__), mind map (by __MindNode__), report and assignment, code file, past exams and so on.

All materials are open-source, and welcome to be shared with needed mates. If you wish to contribute to this repository, please contact through email _yuzhongchen82@gmail.com_.
